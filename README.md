# RentCast API Resources

This repository contains the following resources to help you start working with the RentCast property data API:

- [OpenAPI Specification](openapi-spec/rentcast_api_openapi_spec_v1.json): you can use this JSON file to import our API definition into applications that support the [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/specification/), including Swagger, Stoplight, and others
- [PostMan Collection](postman-collections/rentcast_api_postman_collection_v1.json): you can use this JSON file to manually import our [PostMan](https://postman.com) collection into your own PostMan account to start testing our API and developing your integration. Alternatively, you can fork our [public collection](https://www.postman.com/rentcast/workspace/rentcast-api/collection/34259606-4b4532c7-3e0f-4a51-a019-438a3d68b4c3) directly
